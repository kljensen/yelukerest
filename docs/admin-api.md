# Admin API

Yelukerest admin tooling should prefer the `api` schema exposed by PostgREST over direct writes to `data.*`. Direct table writes couple course repos to storage details and bypass the permissions boundary that students, TAs, faculty, and app tokens use everywhere else.

## Meeting Sync

`api.meetings` already supports faculty CRUD for individual meeting rows. That was not enough for the historical course-admin workflow, which treats the YAML meeting file as the desired complete set:

1. Delete meetings missing from the YAML file.
2. Update meetings whose slugs already exist.
3. Insert meetings whose slugs are new.
4. Commit those changes as one operation and report what happened.

Use the RPC endpoint for that operation:

`POST /rest/rpc/sync_meetings`

Payload:

```json
{
  "p_meetings": [
    {
      "slug": "intro",
      "title": "Introduction",
      "summary": "Short Markdown summary",
      "description": "Long Markdown description",
      "begins_at": "2026-01-14T14:00:00Z",
      "duration": "01:20:00",
      "is_draft": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "inserted_count": 1,
    "updated_count": 3,
    "deleted_count": 0
  }
]
```

The function refuses an empty list, rejects duplicate input slugs, and relies on the `meeting` table constraints for row validation. Only faculty can execute it.
If a missing meeting is still referenced by quizzes, engagements, or other rows, PostgreSQL foreign keys will reject the sync rather than silently deleting related data.

`api.platform_version.admin_api_version` is `2` for deployments that support this RPC.
